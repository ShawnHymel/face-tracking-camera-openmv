# Face Tracking Robot Camera with the OpenMV

Demo code for a pan-tilt camera that tracks and follows the nearest face (i.e. the biggest face in the frame). It is the basis for [@Odd_Jayy](https://twitter.com/Odd_Jayy)'s [Project Helen](https://twitter.com/Odd_Jayy/status/1430614610072145922) face-tracking robot backpack.

This code has been tested on the [OpenMV H7](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/seeed-technology-co-ltd/102991322/11506484) but should also work on the [OpenMV H7 R2](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/sparkfun-electronics/SEN-18982/15789011) and the [OpenMV H7 PLUS](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/dfrobot/DFR0833/14322605).

See this tutorial for a full guide on how to create the face-tracking camera.
